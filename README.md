In this task, we perform different types of SQL joins to combine data from two related tables: Employees and Departments.
INNER JOIN returns only matching records from both tables.
LEFT JOIN retrieves all employees, including those without a department.
RIGHT JOIN returns all departments, even those without employees.
FULL JOIN (or UNION in MySQL) combines all data, showing unmatched records from both tables.
